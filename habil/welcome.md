# Habil 2.0

**Welcome!**

This page is the online copy of my **Habilitation thesis**, submitted to 
the [Faculty of Geo- and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.uibk.ac.at/fakultaeten/geo_und_atmosphaerenwissenschaften/index.html.en) 
at the [University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at), Austria.

A PDF of the thesis (same content) will be made available for download when ready.

## Preface

This habilitation thesis consists of 13 peer reviewed publications completed 
between 2015 and 2020. It also contains two short, previously unpublished chapters 
introducing what I believe to be my most important contributions to the field of 
large-scale glaciology to date: (i) the [Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM)](https://oggm.org), 
an open-source glacier evolution model, and (ii) [OGGM-Edu](https://edu.oggm.org), 
a collaborative educational website about glaciers. All papers, web platforms 
and software presented here were prepared while I was working at the University of Innsbruck.

This thesis addresses several aspects of the numerical modelling of glacier change, 
at various spatial (glacier to global) and temporal (annual to centennial) scales. Thanks to 
the projects I had the chance to contribute to, it also develops some aspects of observational 
glaciology and meteorology. However, the main bulk of this work is focussing on the central 
topic of this thesis: **the development of modern numerical methods to (i) estimate the ice
thickness of mountain glaciers and their volume, (ii) compute their mass-balance and (iii) 
simulate their evolution under climate change**.

A further important theme that is developed in this thesis is the topic of **open science**. 
Because of my personal conviction that all sciencitic results should be openly available, I have 
spent a lot of thought and energy on developing methods and workflows that enable a more open, 
accessible, documented, and reproducible scientific practice. Many of these ideas are not from my 
own invention, but are workflows that I borrowed and adapted from the open-source software 
development community.

All the work presented here is the result of collaborations with numerous students and colleagues. 
These collaborations originate from my work at the University of Innsbruck, but also from a wider 
network of collaborators and with international working groups. Four papers arose from my contributions 
to the doctoral studies of Beatriz Recinos and Julia Eis (University of Bremen), Ben Pelto (University of 
Northern British Columbia) and the master thesis of Tobias Zolles (University of Innsbruck).
